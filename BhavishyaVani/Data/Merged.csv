----------------------------
This is about Apache 2.4.26 under CorTechs Labs (C:\PortalPms\CorTechs Labs\SystemTools\apache\bin), but instead we have updated Log4J to 2.17.0. 
Is it possible to upgrade Apache 2.4.26 to 2.4.54 or later?

My name is Joe Billings reaching out from Aneurin Bevan Health Board.
 
Server: 7A6AUSRVGAMCAM1 Serial No:702131
 
I am reaching out to log a call with your support desk. We have a system running an application called ?Jetpack? that is not currently functional. The portal has service has been re-started, however a number of our users are unable to scan from the Philips Gam Cam Server.
 
Issue: Program for doing gamma camera scanner - Jetpack is application name, error code : can't connect from the modality.
 
Spoke to engineer - He believes the Phillips portal needs restarting - Which is apparently in our server room (already performed)
 
Can this be looked into please, or could someone speak to myself regarding this issue. I have included my contact details should you wish to contact myself below:

Is it possible to reboot the ISP, it no longer receives images from the Brightview XCT. 
Is it possible to inform me as soon as possible when this has happened. So I can put the device back into use.

We have again a problem with the display of Dynacad.
The known bug that was present since the beginning is still there (image only opens half), but also minimize and maximize back does not work currently anymore.
So we only get a part of Dynacad visible and cannot do the processing...
Could you solve this?

Unfortunately we have problems again with the transmission of the remaining perfusion card and its color scaling in Sectra. The CBV and CBF are displayed as in the IntelliSpace, with the remaining cards (MTT and TTP), the color is the same as initially with the first-called cards. Maybe you could take on the problem again.

Hello Rens,
 
We do not see these error messages on the domain controller and the clients.
 
Which DNS server do you have on the ISP11Master?
 
Can you do an NSLookup on the ISP11Matser to: CTD.local and SERNDU001?
How quickly does the result appear?

As a result of this problem I would like to ask you to check this part:

Hello Rens,
 
I just started the IntelliSpace portal on the workstation in the CMH (Utrecht).
The first time logging in works, then no longer, we get the same error message again: Can't retreive authentication service for servers: 10.14.80.3

Hello Rens, Frank,
 
We are still running into problems at Defense when logging into the ISP11Master.
Some tests were made yesterday by our network manager, see attached mail.
 
Could you check these findings and make an adjustment with which logging in works again.
 
Thanks in advance.
Sincerely

Hello Rens,
 
Connecting to port 443 does not work.
Now the authentication source appears very quickly, but when logging in I get the message:

Dear Guido,

Can you try connecting again on port 443 instead of port 80?
Furthermore I renewed a certificate, do not know if this will solve the problem since (what I understood from Frank) was that there are also clients that have no problem?

Hello Frank,
 
On the Domain Controller and workstations of the CT Scanner network the Cumulative Update of October was still running (2022-10 Cumulative Update for Windows Server 2016 for x64-based Systems (KB5018411).
The update of November (2022-11 Cumulative Update for Windows Server 2016 for x64-based Systems KB5019964) has not been installed on purpose because of problems with Kerberos.
 
In the meantime we skipped CU 2022-11 and last Monday 2022-12 Cumulative Update for Windows Server 2016 for x64-based Systems (KB5021235) was installed.
Last Monday the workstation in the CMH was also replaced. Both actions did not solve the problem on the workstation in the CMH (see attached: Fout_IntelliSpacePortal.JPG).
 
During startup of the IntelliSpacePortal (on the workstation) we made a number of network captures and see in it that the communication between the workstations and the ISP11MASTER (10.14.80.3) is not working entirely well (see attached: Capture_ISP_CMH.JPG). The other network traffic between the workstations and for example the Domain Controller on Schiphol went without any problems. We also see similar messages in the communication between the workstation in Maasland and the ISP11Master.
 
The Domain Controller and the ISP11MASTER are at Schiphol in the same switch.
 
Also added the capture file that can be opened with Wireshark (attached: Capture_ISP_CMH.pcapng).
On this there is a filter for the overview in Wireshark so only traffic from and to the 10.14.80.3 can be seen.
 
What we already noticed since the installation of the ISP11MASTER is that on the workstations (when starting the IntelliSpacePortal) it takes at least 8 to 10 seconds before the Authentication Source (CTD) appears.
And since recently the Authentication Source no longer appears in the CMH.
 
Could you check on the ISP11MASTER what could be the reason for the Reset (RST) and Retransmissions in the communication between workstation and ISP server?
 
Thanks in advance.
Sincerely

Dear Guido,
 
We have checked the event logs of the client and do see a number of errors that are related to the connection with domain controller. Among other:

The processing of Group Policy failed because of lack of network connectivity to a domain controller. This may be a transient condition. A success message would be generated once the machine gets connected to the domain controller and Group Policy has successfully processed. If you do not see a success message for several hours, then contact your administrator.

This computer was not able to set up a secure session with a domain controller in domain CTD due to the following: 
We cannot sign you in with this credential because your domain isn't available. Make sure your device is connected to your organization's network and try again. If you previously signed in on this device with another credential, you can sign in with that credential. 
This may lead to authentication problems. Make sure that this computer is connected to the network. If the problem persists, please contact your domain administrator.  
 
ADDITIONAL INFO: 
If this computer is a domain controller for the specified domain, it sets up the secure session to the primary domain controller emulator in the specified domain. Otherwise, this computer sets up the secure session to any domain controller in the specified domain.

We also see DCOM warnings:

The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Launch permission for the COM Server application with CLSID 
Windows.SecurityCenter.SecurityAppBroker
And APPID 
Unavailable
To the user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM SID (S-1-5-18) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.


In the meantime we also received similar messages from another customer which makes us suspect that it could be a Windows patch on the domain server. Can you check if you accidentally patched the domain server with KB5019964?
This can namely explain the problems you are experiencing.
The solution for this is patch: KB5021235
 
Please let me know.

Main reason (Q3)- When changing filtering in ISP it is expected that changing from ascending to enticing filtering will simply invert the list produced. However, when changing the filtering the results varies meaning that the list produced changes. Probably due to some sort of bug when filters are applied.

Impact issue (Q8)- Incorrect filtering with results not being presented as expected.

Usage of device (Q9)- Searching for studies within the ISP application.

Clinical use (Q10)- Yes

Follow up clinical use 1 (Q11)- No

Follow up clinical use 2 (Q12)- Continued

Frequency of occurrence (Q13)- Frequent (>7)

Impact to the patient (Q14_1)- There was no patient impact.

Actions to resolve (Q15_1)- No actions were taken to fix issue. Told customer that I would use this process to feedback the information to development team of IntelliSpace Portal.

Reason for delay (Q62_1)- None",A

Hello Rens,

All modalities that get DMWL from Epic and have Storenode in Sectra, need to be changed to dicom router.

Are there more servers in Antonius that you can convert as far as you know?
I do not know any 2:

1.	ISP gets no DMWL, only store will then change to:

AET: DICOMROUTERPACS1
IP: 172.30.13.127
Port: 1041

Since recently ISP falls under the management of Martijn de Weerd and me. 

2.	The same story is with ISCV. This also needs to be changed. 
Does ISCV have DMWL or HL7? That is only the question.
In principle Monica Groskamp does management. She will eventually contact Philips if necessary.


Both servers use Q/R. Unfortunately it has not yet been set up in dicom router. 
First ICR will set up Q/R, then we need to test and then convert to dicom router.

Now we can in principle not do much, waiting for the ICT.

Gr
Olga

Dear Olga,

I assume that you will send from the router to portal.
This can always be done, you can use the same data as you have in PACS.

The V12.1.5 (base) MSI is installed without problems.

So far nothing can be seen in the log files, and it then looks as if they are successfully installed.

System Name:   INTELLISPACE PORTAL SERVER

System Serial Nr: CZ29280T0

Software Level: 10.1.1.21740

Full Problem Description: 
System fails to connect to hospital network because of network adapter problem.

Problem History / Corrective actions taken: 
The hospital IT shifted the systems from and again back to the same building due to building renovation process, it is when the hospital IT discovered all the network adapters/connections including the hospital LAN was disabled.
We have tried different options to re-enable without success.
 

I reloaded the Server software, but soon after operating system is installed the following error message poped up
 

After this message when pressed ok,currently in the network connections settings is empty in control panel, made several attempts to restore network without success.

Hello support,

There are 12 failed studies in the ISP-Dynacad application.
I restarted the services and tried to resend the jobs.
There are a number of images that fail, but the column next to it says that everything is in.
Can you see what this is because of?

 

Thanks in advance!
Regards Kyra

Best

Several users no longer get to see ROI values and 3D measurement values in IntelliSpace Portal when they go to Step 2 on a CTA STROKE examination in Brain Perfusion.
Under Brain Perfusion they select an Artery and Vein via 'use for calculation', after which they click on the arrow to go to Perfusion Maps:
 

In Perfusion Maps all images are then well visible, but there are no values with ROI measurements or 3D measurements:
 

The error message they see is: ""Scan duration is shorter than the ""Permeability scan duration"" value in the Perfusion Maps Parameters tab, therefore, permeability measurements are not available."":
 

Is this a known problem?
How can we get the values visible again?

Sincerely

Tim Polman

System IntelliSpace Portal, SN 7001259, SW 12.1.4.11348

I got an order to upgrade customer's ISP from v12.1.4 to 12.1.7. According to installation manual, I must before that install a patch version 12.1.5.
But for some reason I can't do this.

System is installed on HyperV virtual machine and is NOT connected to PRS.

While logged in as fse_admin, I ran v12.1.5 updater from ""459801635936 IntelliSpace Portal V12.1.5.11492.iso"", but installation stops on step 3.
It stays there for about 10min. After that installation stops with problem message.

 

With this one.

 

This happened few times. I also tried to use ""300009054411 IS Portal Media Menu V12.1.5.11492.iso"", but with same results. I also tried to stop mentioned service ""PmsRemotingService"" manualy via task manager. But without success.

Do you have any suggestions on this case?
Please find attached installation logfile.

Can one of you create a case for the master server of ISP in MST Enschede (NZW514). This can be booked in the name of Richard van der Plas.
Concerns the URL integration from Synapse PACS to IntelliSpace Portal. This integration does not seem to be working correctly. At first use the integration starts normally. When changing to another patient the Portal/plugin should close. This does not happen. When selecting a new case the Portal does not want to start because it is still open or seems to be open. Hard closing is a workaround, but not desired. 
The procedure should be that the application/opened application closes if a user in PACS goes to another patient, but Portal as program must remain available in the background. For the next case it can then be opened quickly. 

Can you check in consultation with MST if the contents of the URL are correct?
Thanks in advance for processing.

Sincerely

1. Equipment details

Installed Product ID                 83075574

2. Problem description

The customer complained that the patients have disappeared from one of the configured folders. When we check, the patients are on the folder in Windows, but do not appear on the SW.
We tried to do an Upgrade All from the Portal Management Tool, but it gives directly the message ?Upgrade completed?. When we try ?Rebuild All?, on the Local folder appear only 300-400 patients, and on the ?Backup? folder that had previously disappeared shows only a few patients. 

We were wondering if it is possible to reinstall the SW from scratch, but we only can find FCO88100078, and as far as we can see it is not an installation from scratch.

Could you please send us the link to download the complete installation files in order to perform a clean install?


Best regards

It should be noted that in these two measurements, the measurement object is exactly the same and measurement points are set on the same. Attached two patient examples. They were never sent, they are anonymizing and sending the examples to me as-of-writing. We have used the results of unit size to make the decision on choice of valve. If this measurement is too big, this could potentially lead to a choice of wrong valve design and size which in turn can lead to aplication. This matter was brought to our attention recently since the analysis of a few patient with 3Mensio software, which results were regularly a couple of mm smaller than the measurements form our tool for choice of size of units. In other word, the results from Philips software and 3Mensio were not matching each other.",A

Error description: Customer complains about poor performance of the system. 
- During a hospitation on the MRI, Dr. Jung von der Neurorad showed her workflow between PACS and ISP for the creation of the diffusion images for diagnosis with MS patients.
- The functionality with ISP is great, but the performance leaves much to be desired. 
- The image upload in the ISP takes 30 to 40 seconds. The time in which the donut runs is very annoying in the workflow.

Good day,

Unfortunately we have a problem with the IntelliSpace, we currently cannot send to PACS.

Unfortunately poor, since we reconstruct poly-rooms with the program.

Request for quick processing.

PACS as transmission target is not available for selection.

The logging of DynaCAD says the following:

 

Maybe something filled up, but I do not know how I can check the cache of DynaCAD, or how I can clean it.

Since yesterday ISP can no longer be reached via the Hostname: p-isp-rng.szal.med
Has something changed here for you?
It can now only be reached via the IP address: 10.82.0.151

 

But this is set up on all stations via Hostname: p-isp-rng.szal.med.
Can you make sure that this works again? 
Otherwise this needs to be adjusted manually per workstation.

Our IMT cannot do anything with this because the management is with you.

I would like to hear from you, 
Thanks in advance.

Sincerely

On behalf of PACS group

We see in our monitoring system that IntelliSpace Portal is frequently not accessible via the network.
It mainly is bldisp (virtual server), bldispm01 (master) and bldispb01 (backup). The slave and test server do not have these problems.

We see in the event viewer on the servers no errors/warnings that explain the failures.
Nor is it a restart (the uptime on the servers is longer than the moments where the failure was).
Network management of the UMC indicates that they see no errors/failures on the network connections of the servers.

In the attachments screenshots from our monitoring program.

Does Philips have any idea what could cause this?

Sincerely

Tim Polman

Good morning support,

It strikes me that the auto-delete function on the server does not work well. Can you take a look at this?

Thanks in advance,

when i open client and click set monitors it shows me that i have set one diagnostic and one administrative display, on smaller display shows directory and images are on big display, i can use compare function on one display but cant compare on two displays. I tried set in properties>compatibility> high resolution settings according manual but this not helped, 


only if i set same resolution for both displays this option works, but looks very bad so small resolution on big display

its possible some way use this function for displays with different resolution ?

attached screenshots for better understand

thank you",A

Good afternoon.
We are facing a very strange issue on an ISP IX/LX (original 11.1.1) since more than a year now. I have contacted pms response in Dec 2022 (Case Number 0120955912) but since i was not trained, I didn?t get help but got below advise:
The reason why you are facing issues is because the system is NOT configured at all: system doesn?t have an IP address; CCT tool is not configured; ISP version not defined for licensing.
Our conclusion is that the system is not installed correctly, this must be done by a certified engineer.

Today im nearly done with my training and my trainer told me that i can contact ICAP team for help so kindly find below summary, also If it was installed incorrectly, why did it worked and tested by client for sometimes then fail?

I install the system end 2020 and it has been working fine for a year. Then we first got the issue:
-	Client can?t connect anymore to app. Error network adapter.
-	FSE_admin also cannot connect. I get error please verify your network configuration and another error verify portal installation.
-	I have tried reactivating in CCT but error license check fail.
-	Have tried activation in postinstallation tools and it was successful but still same error.
-	Have tried everything and end up reloading complete os and app.

It worked well for three months then same issue.

Have updated to 11.1.3 got the license updated and it again worked for some months then same issue again.

From there I reinstalled 5 times and last Monday issue came again, note that system is not connected to internet and no windows update applied.

Below link to log and attached some pictures for info.
https://we.tl/t-NqJtgmuUTB

The client is fuming and we really can?t continue to reload os and app every 1 or 2 months. If issue was from our side, I would have understand but system cannot work after a fresh install then fail later. Can you please help.

Can you help with the following?
From synapse PACS we have the possibility to open the ISP with the image.

When clicking on the link it hangs on this:

 

And does not do anything else.  The only option to close is via task management.
We also have a link to MagicGlass (the same link is provided - only that the app is of course started) and that does work.

Below is what is behind the link:

 

The StudyUID exists in the ISP:

 

The ISP itself works correctly.
What can this be?


Thanks in advance!

Hello 

Recently the radiologist indicates that the ISP crashes when using mammo and nodus analysis.
I checked the last nodus analysis and made printscreens.
Application got so stuck that no button is still active; also the message/question to create a bug report did not seem to work.
Can you say something about this based on the print screens?

Please your response

Sincerely
Yvonne Rikkers-Arts

Zou je een case voor mij kunnen aanmaken voor ziekenhuis IJsselland Capelle ad IJssel op naam van Robert Spoel?
Betreft onderstaande informatie met als titel ?Autoprocessing ClearRead CAD fails during processing?

ClearRead CAD and (Philips CT Incisive) data compatibility
Customer would like to use ClearRead CAD for autodetection of nodules based on Chest CTs of their Incisive CT. 
Auto processing rules are set in the preferences (based on series description) and processing is starting, however fails somewhere in the process.
Semi-automatic processing (via run processing -> LNA Algorithms) succeed and results are available. 
 
Screenshot shows a serie with 3 'images' based on autoprocessing, LNA does not show results in LNA application and a serie with 12 'images' based on semi-automatic processing which shows the CAD suggestions in the LNA app and in MMV. 
 
My question is: What can cause the fail of automatic processing which is starting. Issue is specific seen on Incisive Scandata.

Ik zal een en ander escaleren.
Dank alvast!

Hi Rens,

Could you check why the queue manager in our production environment continuously shows 1 study on status waiting?
Thanks in advance!
